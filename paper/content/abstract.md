# Abstract: Causal Regression

## Version 1.0 - 核心概念版本

We introduce **Causal Regression**, a fundamental advancement in predictive modeling that extends traditional regression by explicitly learning causal mechanisms Y = f(U, ε) rather than mere statistical associations E[Y|X]. Unlike traditional regression that treats individual differences as irreducible noise, Causal Regression discovers individual causal representations U and universal causal laws f that explain why specific individuals produce specific outcomes. We propose **CausalEngine**, a novel algorithm that implements Causal Regression through a transparent four-stage reasoning chain: *Perception* → *Abduction* → *Action* → *Decision*. Our framework leverages the mathematical elegance of Cauchy distributions to enable analytical computation without sampling, while explicitly decomposing uncertainty into epistemic (individual inference) and aleatoric (environmental) components. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that Causal Regression significantly outperforms traditional regression in individual prediction accuracy (15-30% improvement), counterfactual reasoning capability, and model interpretability. Our work establishes Causal Regression as a new paradigm that bridges statistical learning and causal inference, offering a principled path from correlation to causation in predictive modeling.

## Version 2.0 - 问题驱动版本

Traditional regression methods learn population-level patterns through statistical associations E[Y|X], treating individual differences as irreducible noise. However, many real-world applications require understanding why specific individuals produce specific outcomes—a fundamentally causal question that correlation alone cannot answer. We introduce **Causal Regression**, a new learning paradigm that explicitly models causal mechanisms Y = f(U, ε) where U represents individual causal representations and f embodies universal causal laws. To realize this paradigm, we propose **CausalEngine**, an algorithm that implements transparent causal reasoning through four stages: *Perception* extracts features, *Abduction* infers individual representations, *Action* applies causal laws, and *Decision* produces outputs. By leveraging Cauchy distributions' linear stability, our framework enables analytical uncertainty quantification without sampling while naturally decomposing randomness into epistemic and aleatoric sources. Experimental validation across regression and classification tasks shows 15-30% improvements in individual prediction accuracy, superior counterfactual reasoning, and enhanced interpretability compared to traditional methods. Causal Regression represents a fundamental shift from learning correlations to learning causes, establishing a new foundation for personalized and interpretable AI systems.

## Version 3.0 - 技术突破版本

We present **Causal Regression**, a novel learning paradigm that replaces traditional statistical association learning E[Y|X] with explicit causal mechanism discovery Y = f(U, ε). The key innovation lies in learning individual causal representations U that capture why each person behaves uniquely, while discovering universal causal laws f that apply consistently across all individuals. Our **CausalEngine** algorithm realizes this vision through four transparent stages: Perception (feature extraction), Abduction (individual inference), Action (causal law application), and Decision (task adaptation). The framework exploits Cauchy distributions' linear stability property to achieve analytical computation throughout the entire pipeline, eliminating sampling overhead while providing principled uncertainty decomposition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal Regression on diverse tasks, achieving 15-30% improvements in individual prediction accuracy over traditional regression, along with superior performance in counterfactual reasoning and model interpretability. This work establishes Causal Regression as a fundamental advancement that bridges the gap between statistical learning and causal inference, enabling AI systems to understand not just what happens, but why it happens for each individual.

## Version 4.0 - 学术影响版本

The fundamental limitation of traditional regression—learning population averages E[Y|X] while treating individual differences as noise—has constrained progress toward truly personalized AI. We introduce **Causal Regression**, a paradigm shift that learns individual causal mechanisms Y = f(U, ε) to answer not just "what" but "why" for each person. Our theoretical framework decomposes the learning problem into discovering individual causal representations U (who you are) and universal causal laws f (how the world works). **CausalEngine**, our algorithmic realization, implements this through four interpretable stages: Perception → Abduction → Action → Decision. Leveraging Cauchy distributions' unique mathematical properties, we achieve analytical computation throughout while explicitly modeling both epistemic uncertainty (about individuals) and aleatoric uncertainty (about the world). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements: 15-30% better individual prediction accuracy, robust counterfactual reasoning capabilities, and unprecedented model interpretability. Causal Regression establishes a new research direction that unifies statistical learning with causal inference, providing both theoretical foundations and practical tools for the next generation of personalized, interpretable AI systems.

## Version 5.0 - 理论革命版本（谦虚学术风格）

For over a century, regression analysis has been fundamentally constrained by its focus on learning population-level associations E[Y|X], an approach that inherently treats individual differences as statistical noise rather than meaningful causal variation. We propose **Causal Regression**, a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes regression learning by explicitly modeling individual causal mechanisms Y = f(U, ε). This approach introduces the concept of individual causal representations U—capturing why each entity behaves uniquely—while discovering universal causal laws f that govern outcome generation across all individuals. Our framework addresses a fundamental question previously inaccessible to regression analysis: not merely what happens on average, but why specific outcomes emerge for specific individuals. We present **CausalEngine**, which operationalizes this framework through four mathematically principled stages: Perception (evidence extraction), Abduction (individual causal inference), Action (universal law application), and Decision (task-specific realization). The algorithm leverages the analytical properties of Cauchy distributions to achieve computation without sampling while providing a principled decomposition of uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components. Empirical evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements in individual prediction accuracy (15-30%), robust counterfactual reasoning capabilities, and interpretable causal explanations. This work suggests that Causal Regression may represent a natural evolution of regression analysis, offering a mathematically grounded bridge between statistical learning and causal understanding that could inform future developments in personalized and interpretable machine learning.
