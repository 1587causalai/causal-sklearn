\begin{abstract}
We introduce \textbf{Causal Regression}, a new learning paradigm that extends traditional regression by explicitly modeling causal mechanisms $Y = f(U, \varepsilon)$ rather than mere statistical associations $E[Y|X]$. Unlike traditional regression that learns population-level patterns, Causal Regression discovers individual causal representations $U$ and universal causal laws $f$ that explain why specific individuals produce specific outcomes. We propose \causalengine{}, a novel algorithm that implements Causal Regression through a four-stage transparent reasoning chain: \textit{Perception} $\rightarrow$ \textit{Abduction} $\rightarrow$ \textit{Action} $\rightarrow$ \textit{Decision}. Our framework leverages the mathematical elegance of Cauchy distributions to enable analytical computation without sampling, while explicitly modeling both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that Causal Regression significantly outperforms traditional regression in individual prediction accuracy, counterfactual reasoning, and model interpretability. Our work establishes Causal Regression as a fundamental advancement in predictive modeling, offering a principled path from correlation to causation.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% Motivation and Problem Statement
The foundational question of predictive modeling has long been: \textit{Given observed features $X$, what is the expected outcome $Y$?} Traditional regression approaches answer this through statistical association learning, seeking functions $f$ that minimize $\expectation[(Y - f(X))^2]$. While this paradigm has been remarkably successful, it fundamentally treats individual differences as irreducible noise, focusing on population-level patterns rather than understanding the causal mechanisms that generate outcomes for specific individuals.

% The Need for Causal Regression
We argue that many real-world applications require a deeper understanding: \textit{Why does this specific individual produce this specific outcome?} This question cannot be answered by correlation aloneâ€”it requires modeling the causal mechanisms that link individual characteristics to outcomes. Consider personalized medicine, where understanding why a patient responds to treatment requires knowledge of their individual biological processes, not just population averages. Similarly, in education, explaining why a student performs well requires understanding their individual learning mechanisms, not just statistical correlations between test scores and demographics.

% Introducing Causal Regression
In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Causal Regression}, a new learning paradigm that extends traditional regression by explicitly modeling causal mechanisms. Instead of learning $E[Y|X]$, Causal Regression learns the structural equation:
\begin{equation}
Y = f(U, \varepsilon)
\end{equation}
where $U$ represents individual causal representations inferred from observed evidence $X$, $\varepsilon$ captures environmental randomness, and $f$ is a universal causal law that applies consistently across all individuals.

% Technical Contribution
To realize Causal Regression, we propose \causalengine{}, a novel algorithm that implements this paradigm through four transparent stages: (1) \textit{Perception} extracts high-level features from raw data, (2) \textit{Abduction} infers individual causal representations, (3) \textit{Action} applies universal causal laws, and (4) \textit{Decision} produces task-specific outputs. Our framework leverages Cauchy distributions' linear stability property to enable analytical computation without sampling, while explicitly modeling both epistemic uncertainty (from individual inference) and aleatoric uncertainty (from environmental noise).

% Main Contributions
The main contributions of this work are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Conceptual Innovation}: We formally define Causal Regression as a new learning paradigm that bridges statistical learning and causal inference.

\item \textbf{Theoretical Framework}: We establish the mathematical foundation for individual causal representation learning, grounded in structural causal models and distribution theory.

\item \textbf{Empirical Validation}: We demonstrate significant improvements over traditional regression in individual prediction, counterfactual reasoning, and model interpretability across diverse datasets.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

% Traditional Regression Methods
\subsection{Traditional Regression}
Traditional regression methods, from linear regression to modern neural networks, focus on learning the conditional expectation $E[Y|X]$ through various optimization objectives. While these methods have achieved remarkable success in many applications, they fundamentally treat individual differences as noise and focus on population-level patterns \cite{hastie2009elements}.

% Causal Inference
\subsection{Causal Inference}
The field of causal inference, pioneered by Pearl \cite{pearl2009causality} and others, provides theoretical foundations for reasoning about cause and effect. Structural Causal Models (SCMs) offer a mathematical framework for representing causal relationships, while methods like instrumental variables and randomized controlled trials enable causal effect estimation from observational data \cite{imbens2015causal}.

% Individual Treatment Effects
\subsection{Individual Treatment Effects}
Recent work on heterogeneous treatment effects focuses on estimating individual-level causal effects \cite{kunzel2019metalearners, nie2021quasi}. However, these methods typically assume known treatments and focus on effect estimation rather than learning general causal mechanisms.

% Representation Learning
\subsection{Representation Learning}
Deep learning has revolutionized representation learning, enabling automatic discovery of useful features from raw data \cite{bengio2013representation}. However, most representation learning focuses on predictive performance rather than causal understanding.

% Our Positioning
\subsection{Our Contribution}
Causal Regression bridges these areas by providing a unified framework that combines representation learning with causal reasoning. Unlike traditional regression, we explicitly model individual causal mechanisms. Unlike causal inference, we focus on prediction tasks with learned representations. Unlike individual treatment effect estimation, we learn general causal laws rather than specific treatment effects.

\section{Causal Regression: Concept and Theory}
\label{sec:concept}

% Formal Definition
\subsection{Formal Definition}

We formally define Causal Regression as follows:

\begin{definition}[Causal Regression]
Causal Regression is a learning paradigm that aims to discover the underlying causal mechanism $f$ in the structural equation:
\begin{equation}
Y = f(U, \varepsilon)
\end{equation}
where $U$ is an individual causal representation inferred from observed evidence $X$, $\varepsilon$ is exogenous noise, and $f$ is a universal causal law.
\end{definition}

% Mathematical Framework
\subsection{Mathematical Framework}

The key insight of Causal Regression is the decomposition of the learning problem into two interconnected components:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Individual Inference}: Learning a function $g: X \rightarrow P(U)$ that maps observed evidence to a distribution over individual causal representations.

\item \textbf{Causal Mechanism Learning}: Learning a universal function $f: U \times \varepsilon \rightarrow Y$ that maps individual representations and environmental noise to outcomes.
\end{enumerate}

The complete learning objective becomes:
\begin{equation}
\{f^*, g^*\} = \arg\min_{f,g} \expectation[-\log p(Y|U,\varepsilon)] \text{ where } U \sim g(X)
\end{equation}

% Individual Causal Representations
\subsection{Individual Causal Representations}

Central to our framework is the concept of individual causal representations $U$. These serve a dual role:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Individual Selection Variable}: $U = u$ represents selecting a specific individual $u$ from all possible individuals.

\item \textbf{Individual Causal Representation}: The vector $u$ encodes all intrinsic properties that drive this individual's behavior.
\end{enumerate}

Since true individual representations are unobservable, we infer them from limited evidence $X$. The inference process identifies a subpopulation of individuals consistent with the observed evidence, characterized by the posterior distribution $P(U|X)$.

% Uncertainty Decomposition
\subsection{Uncertainty Decomposition}

Our framework explicitly models two types of uncertainty:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Epistemic Uncertainty}: Uncertainty about individual representations due to limited evidence, captured by the scale parameter of $P(U|X)$.

\item \textbf{Aleatoric Uncertainty}: Environmental randomness that cannot be reduced by better models, captured by the exogenous noise $\varepsilon$.
\end{enumerate}

This decomposition enables more principled uncertainty quantification and decision-making under uncertainty.

\section{The \causalengine{} Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

% Overview
\subsection{Algorithm Overview}

\causalengine{} implements Causal Regression through a four-stage transparent reasoning chain:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Perception}: Extract high-level features $Z$ from raw data $X$
\item \textbf{Abduction}: Infer individual causal representations $U$ from features $Z$
\item \textbf{Action}: Apply universal causal laws to compute decision distributions $S$
\item \textbf{Decision}: Transform decision distributions to task-specific outputs $Y$
\end{enumerate}

% Stage 1: Perception
\subsection{Stage 1: Perception}

The Perception stage extracts meaningful features from raw input data:
\begin{equation}
Z = \text{Perception}(X)
\end{equation}

This stage can utilize any feature extraction method, from traditional feature engineering to deep neural networks. The key requirement is that $Z$ should capture information relevant to identifying individual causal representations.

% Stage 2: Abduction
\subsection{Stage 2: Abduction}

The Abduction stage infers individual causal representations from extracted features. Given the dual nature of uncertainty in real-world scenarios, we model the posterior distribution using Cauchy distributions:

\begin{align}
\mu_U &= W_{\text{loc}} \cdot Z + b_{\text{loc}} \\
\gamma_U &= \text{softplus}(W_{\text{scale}} \cdot Z + b_{\text{scale}}) \\
U &\sim \cauchy(\mu_U, \gamma_U)
\end{align}

The choice of Cauchy distribution is motivated by three key properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Heavy Tails}: Honestly expresses "open world" uncertainty
\item \textbf{Undefined Moments}: Mathematically captures our inability to fully characterize individuals
\item \textbf{Linear Stability}: Enables analytical computation without sampling
\end{enumerate}

% Stage 3: Action
\subsection{Stage 3: Action}

The Action stage applies universal causal laws to individual representations. We incorporate exogenous noise to model environmental randomness:

\begin{align}
U' &= U + b_{\text{noise}} \cdot \varepsilon \\
S &= W_{\text{action}} \cdot U' + b_{\text{action}}
\end{align}

where $\varepsilon \sim \cauchy(0, 1)$ is standard exogenous noise and $b_{\text{noise}}$ is a learnable parameter controlling noise intensity.

Due to Cauchy distribution's linear stability, we can analytically compute:
\begin{equation}
S \sim \cauchy(W_{\text{action}} \cdot \mu_U + b_{\text{action}}, |W_{\text{action}}| \cdot (\gamma_U + |b_{\text{noise}}|))
\end{equation}

% Stage 4: Decision
\subsection{Stage 4: Decision}

The Decision stage transforms abstract decision distributions to task-specific outputs through learnable structural equations $\tau$:

\begin{equation}
Y = \tau(S)
\end{equation}

For different tasks, we use different structural equations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Regression}: $\tau(s) = s$ (identity mapping)
\item \textbf{Classification}: $\tau(s) = \indicator(s > c)$ (threshold function)
\item \textbf{Custom Tasks}: Learnable neural networks
\end{enumerate}

% Training Procedure
\subsection{Training Procedure}

Training \causalengine{} involves optimizing all stages jointly through maximum likelihood estimation. The specific loss function depends on the task and structural equation used in the Decision stage.

For regression tasks, we use Cauchy negative log-likelihood:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}} = -\sum_{i=1}^n \log p_{\cauchy}(y_i | \mu_{S_i}, \gamma_{S_i})
\end{equation}

For classification tasks, we use One-vs-Rest binary cross-entropy:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{clf}} = -\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K [y_{i,k} \log P_{i,k} + (1-y_{i,k}) \log(1-P_{i,k})]
\end{equation}

where $P_{i,k} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{\pi} \arctan\left(\frac{\mu_{S_{i,k}} - c}{\gamma_{S_{i,k}}}\right)$ is the probability that decision score exceeds threshold $c$.

The key contributions of this work are: (1) formal definition of Causal Regression as a bridge between statistical learning and causal inference, (2) theoretical framework for individual causal representation learning, (3) practical algorithm that realizes these concepts, and (4) comprehensive experimental validation.

Causal Regression represents a fundamental advancement in predictive modeling, offering a principled path from correlation to causation. As we move toward more personalized and interpretable AI systems, this paradigm provides essential tools for understanding not just what will happen, but why it happens for each individual.
